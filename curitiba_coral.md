project_brief:
  In an environment where communication materials
  tend to be outdated and little inventive, Curitiba
  Choir sought a new identity designed towards
  a young audience (15-35) that would be bold,
  contemporary and relevant. With clear goals
  to be reached, we developed a visual system based
  on a concise symbol, vivid color gradients alongside
  a clean and direct typography.
