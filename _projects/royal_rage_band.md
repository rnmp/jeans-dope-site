project_brief: Royal Rage is a band that has a dark and dystopian aesthetics, using
  symbols of war, power and despair to convey an aggressive atmosphere. For the family
  of posters, a dark, religious/cult-like style was chosen, using metal, sharp edges
  and blackletter to create a set of designs that were different from what the band
  had previously developed but that would still feel as part of what the band wants
  to represent.
