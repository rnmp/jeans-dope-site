project_brief: "Tulli is an engineering and interior design company focused on high-end
  housing projects. For the visual identity, it was sought to create a firm, minimalist
  and concise aesthetics that would reflect the way the company manages and executes
  its projects, from planning to execution and final delivery.\n\nThe logo has precise
  geometric modularity, capable of being unfolded and adapted retaining recognizability.
  \nIts shapes also enable the creation of patterns, ensuring that the visual identity
  does not get monotonous."
