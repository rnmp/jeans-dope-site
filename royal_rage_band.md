project_brief: Linsingen is a font family inspired by Brazilian tea barrel labels
  printed with lithography in the beginning of the 20th century. The family consists
  of three styles - Linsingen Vintage, which preserves the shapes found in the original
  prints; Linsingen Moderna, a contemporary interpretation of the original shapes,
  with increased contrast and sharper lines; and Linsingen Stencil. All of the three
  styles are suited for titles and headlines.
